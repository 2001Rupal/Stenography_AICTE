# Stenography_AICTE
This is a Stenography Project of AICTE with IBMSkillsbuild.


This project successfully implements steganography-based encryption and decryption to securely hide and retrieve messages within images. By embedding text into pixel values while maintaining the imageâ€™s visual integrity, it ensures confidentiality and undetectability. The integration of passcode protection adds an extra layer of security, making it suitable for private communication, digital watermarking, and secure data transmission.
With its cross-platform compatibility, minimal data distortion, and scalability, this system stands out as an innovative solution for individuals, businesses, and security professionals seeking covert and secure information exchange.

Enter the path of the image to encrypt: hello_world.jpg
Enter the secret message: "HELLO RUPAL"
